# World Economic Indicator Dataset Analysis
This analysis aims to determine which factors a country should focus on to sustain GDP/Capita. The dataset used is the World Economic Indicator Dataset, which contains various parameters for different countries and regions that can impact GDP/Capita. The analysis was conducted using data cleaning, merging, and correlation checking methods.

## Findings
The analysis revealed the following key findings:

1. The relation between GDP/Capita and Lending Interest Rate behaves differently for countries with high GDP/Capita and low GDP/Capita. Countries with high GDP/Capita have a positive impact of lending interest on their GDP/Capita, while for the rest of the countries, the impact is slightly negative.
2. Countries with higher GDP/Capita are able to spend more on health, which ultimately improves the life expectancy of people in that country. Therefore, countries should focus on improving their GDP/Capita to spend more on health.
3. Tourism inbound and outbound both have a positive impact on GDP/Capita. However, tourism outbound showed better positive impact on GDP/Capita. Therefore, countries should focus on promoting tourism to sustain their GDP/Capita.
4. No major findings were found between GDP/Capita and energy consumption.
5. Countries with higher GDP/Capita should focus on controlling their CO2 emissions to sustain their GDP/Capita.
The relation between GDP/Capita and birth rate and infant mortality is inversely proportional. Lower GDP/Capita countries should put a watch on birth rate and infant mortality, while countries with higher GDP/Capita are doing well in this area.
6. Countries with higher GDP/Capita have a better life expectancy, as they can spend more on health and provide better life quality.
Developed countries or higher GDP/Capita countries have an old population, whereas poor and developing nations have a young population. Countries should focus on having a young population, which means more workforce.
7. GDP/Capita and business-related factors such as Business Tax Rate, Days to Start Business, Ease of Business, and Hours to do Tax have negligible effects with respect to GDP/Capita.
8. Internet and mobile phone usage have negligible effects on GDP/Capita.
9. Based on these findings, countries should focus on improving their GDP/Capita to sustain their economy, spend more on health, control CO2 emissions, promote tourism, and monitor birth rate and infant mortality.
