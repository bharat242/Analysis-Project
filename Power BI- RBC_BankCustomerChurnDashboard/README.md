# Churn Analysis using PowerBI
Bank Churn Analysis I am excited to share the dashboard and the report that I have built using Power BI.

Report: RBC churn analysis. Customer retention is one of the biggest challenges facing companies around the world. A lot of resources, hard work & planning go into bringing customers on board & customer attrition makes companies do the extra exercise of bringing new customers to fill the void alongside targeted expansion activities. Churn rate analytics is the solution that can prevent this leakage of customer loss

My experience with Power Bi was greatly enhanced through this project by: Creating New Measures & Columns with DAX, Bookmark Navigator Buttons, Actions, Smart Narrative feature, Matrix with Icons using Conditional Formatting, etc. In order to create this report, I followed the steps below:

Business requirement gathering
Data Gathering from the website
Cleaning data in the PowerQuery editor
Data modeling
Created measures using DAX
Calculated Overall churn Percentages, Total Customers w.r.t Active/Inactive category, created credit score type, Churn % by Year & Month, Exit Customers, and Previous month's Exit Customers
Used Bookmarks for moving from the previous month's exit customers to the churn % matrix
