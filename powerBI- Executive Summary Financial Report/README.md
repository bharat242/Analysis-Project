Power BI Executive Summary Financial Report
This repository contains a Power BI project focused on creating an executive summary financial report. The report was designed 
to answer our manager's top questions, including:

Which month and year had the most profit?
Which country/region is the company seeing the most success in?
Which product and segment should the company continue to invest in?

To clean the data, we removed discontinued products, changed the format of items sold to whole numbers, and corrected channel 
partner names. The dashboard includes major KPIs and insightful visuals with slicers to filter the data.

Based on our analysis, we found that December 2014 had the most profit, and the company is seeing the most success in Europe,
specifically France and Germany. We also recommend that the company continue to invest in the Paseo product and target the 
Small Business and Government segments.

The insights gained from this report could be useful for future expansion plans, targeted marketing efforts, and product 
development strategies.
